Updated from RedKite CMS Beta 1
===============================

This release introduces Twitter Bootstrap 3 and provides support for Twitter Bootstrap 2.x.
Due to this improvement, the Twitter Bootstrap paths have been refactored as follows:

Previous release:

    ./web/components/redkitecms/twitter-bootstrap

Current release:

    ./web/components/redkitecms/twitter-bootstrap/2.x
    ./web/components/redkitecms/twitter-bootstrap/3.x

Because of that change, you must update all the references that points the old paths. This
usually involves themes:

    {% stylesheets  filter='?yui_css,cssrewrite' 'components/redkitecms/twitter-bootstrap/2.x/css/bootstrap.min.css' %} 

When you completed that task, clear the cache and run the assetic:dump command:

    php app/console ca:c --env=rkcms_dev
    php app/console assetic:dump --env=rkcms_dev

If it compiles correctly all assets you are done, otherwise you must find the old paths and repeat
the previous step again.

Please take note that removing the cache could not be enough to update assetic routes. For this reason,
it's strongly suggestes to delete the ./web/css and .web/js folders, before running the assets:dump command.
